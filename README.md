Project Overview
The Sudoku Solver takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid as input and fills in the missing numbers according to Sudoku rules:

Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition.
The program employs a backtracking algorithm, testing each empty cell in the grid and recursively searching for a valid solution.

Features
Input Sudoku Grid: Load a 9x9 grid with partially filled numbers.
Solve Puzzle: Automatically solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
Display Solution: Output the completed grid with the correct solution.
Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries are required.
